# Project Yolo

## Getting Started

### iOS App
* Install CocoaPods Objective-C library manager [here](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods)
* Run the following commands:

```bash
cd app
pod install
```

* Make all changes, build, and run in Promptu.xcworkspace, NOT Promptu.xcodeproj
* Remember to re-install the pods every time latest changes are pulled
